# This repository contains my Python 2.7 assignments for the Introduction to Computer Science course at University of Piraeus. The 4 assignments are: 1) A game of Bingo for 100 players, repeated 1000 times. It outputs the average numbers that need to be announced so that there is a winner (bingo.py). 2) A converter of integers to roman/latin numerals (intLatin.py). 3) A Brainfuck interpreter (brainfuck.py).
