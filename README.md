# This repository contains my Python 2.7 assignments for the Introduction to Computer Science course at University of Piraeus. The 4 assignments are: 
1) A game of Bingo for 100 players, repeated 1000 times. It outputs the average number of announcements so that there is a winner (bingo.py). 
2) A converter of integers to roman/latin numerals (intLatin.py). 
3) A Brainfuck interpreter input is a file from the user (brainfuck.py).
4) A wordsearch in a square 100 x 100 with input a file from the user. The code is awful, brute force ftw (square.py).
